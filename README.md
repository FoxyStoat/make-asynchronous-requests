# Make Asynchronous Requests

**Project for Udacity Ajax course. Make asynchronous requests using three different methods:**

* the XHR object (lesson 1)
* jQuery's .ajax() method (lesson 2)
* the Fetch API (lesson 3)

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.
