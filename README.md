# Make Asynchronous Requests

**Project for Udacity Ajax course. Make asynchronous requests using three different methods:**

* the XHR object (lesson 1)
* jQuery's .ajax() method (lesson 2)
* the Fetch API (lesson 3)

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.

## What is the Project?

It is a simple app that uses a form to let you search for something you're interested in, it will then display an image and some articles about it.

To run this app either clone or download this repo and open up the index.html file, alternatively click [here](https://foxystoat.github.io/make-asynchronous-requests/) for a live preview of the app.
